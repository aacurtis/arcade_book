Drawing With Functions
======================

We learned how to draw in :ref:`how-to-draw`.
In :ref:`lab-02` we applied that to create our own drawing.
We learned how to create functions in :ref:`creating_functions`.
In this chapter, we'll combine all that knowledge to create our own drawing functions.

We'll do that by expanding on the code you wrote for :ref:`lab-02`.

To show you how, I'm going to start with a similar program and convert it to
using functions.

First the original program:

.. image:: snowman1.png
    :width: 50%

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a1.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Ok, it isn't very fancy, but that will make this process easier to follow.

.. _make_the_main_function:

Make The ``main`` Function
--------------------------

After copying the code into Lab 3, we'll create a ``main()`` function.
Put everything in it, and call the ``main`` function.

Are those too many lines to indent? You can indent groups of lines by
selecting them, and then hitting "tab". If you want to un-indent a group of
lines, hit shift-tab.

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

After this, run your program and make sure it still works before proceeding.
If it doesn't work, stop and get help. Continuing will only make the problem
harder.

Make The Drawing Functions
--------------------------

Next, pick an item to move to a function. Start with an easy one if you have it.

Grass Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I chose grass to start withbecause it was only one line of code, and I wasn't
going to ever try to position it with an x, y coordinate.

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a3.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 7-9, 17

Test, and make sure it is working.

Snow Person Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's take the more complex snow person and put it in a function.

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a4.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 12-22, 31

But this draws the snowman only at one spot. I want to draw lots of snowmen,
anywhere I put them!

To do this, let's add an x and y:

.. image:: snowman2.png
    :width: 50%

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a5.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 12, 19-21, 24-25, 34

But that's not perfect. If you'll note, I added a dot at the x and y. The
snowman draws way off from the dot, because originally I didn't try to draw
it at 0, 0. I need to recenter the snowman on the dot.

We need to re-center the shape onto the spot we are drawing. Typically you'll
need to subtract from all the x and y values the same amount.

.. image:: snowman3.png
    :width: 50%

.. literalinclude:: drawing_with_functions_a6.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:


.. _animate-drawing:

How To Animate A Drawing Function
---------------------------------

We can animate our drawing if we want. Here are the steps.

Create An ``on_draw`` Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Right now our program only draws our image once. We need to move all the drawing code
in our ``main`` to an ``on_draw`` function. Then we'll tell the computer to draw
that over and over.

Continuing from our last example, our program will look like:

.. literalinclude:: animate_1.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 28-34, 41-42

Do this with your own program. Nothing will move, but it should still run.

Add Variable To Control Where We Draw Our Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we are going to create a variable inside of the ``on_draw`` function.
This variable will hold our *x* value.
Each time we call ``on_draw``, we'll change *x* so that it moves to the right.

.. literalinclude:: animate_2.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 33, 36-42
